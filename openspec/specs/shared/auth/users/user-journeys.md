## User journeys

### shared-auth-users-US-01: Operator lists people in the identity directory

**As an** operator who can list users,
**I want** to search and open accounts by user id,
**so that** I can find a person without seeing records I am not granted.

### shared-auth-users-US-02: Operator bans and unbans an account

**As an** operator who can ban,
**I want** a ban to stop money-moving and sign-in, and an unban to restore them,
**so that** a person who must leave cannot keep acting, a mistaken ban is
reversible, and a compromised admin cannot lock peer admins out by ban.

### shared-auth-users-US-03: Operator changes roles

**As an** admin,
**I want** to set roles on any account I can open — including my own — and to
strip my own `admin` when another admin remains, without stripping `admin`
from a peer,
**so that** ordinary grants and cooperative offboarding stay in the console and
peer lockout does not.

### shared-auth-users-US-04: Operator finds the accounts they mean

**As an** operator who can list users,
**I want** to search by the name I was given and narrow the directory to the
accounts I mean,
**so that** I can reach one person from a ticket, and answer who holds a role,
without reading every account.
