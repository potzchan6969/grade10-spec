## User journeys

### shared-auth-audit-US-01: Operator's identity action is recorded

**As an** operator,
**I want** a ban, unban, set-role, or revoke — including a refusal — on the identity trail,
**so that** a dispute can name who did what, by user id, without secrets.

### shared-auth-audit-US-02: Auditor reads the identity trail

**As an** auditor,
**I want** to read the trail and check it is consistent,
**so that** I can answer whether the record holds without being shown the proof.

### shared-auth-audit-US-03: Operator cannot act off the trail

**As an** operator,
**I want** an action that cannot be recorded to be refused,
**so that** the trail is not a best-effort log of what already happened.

### shared-auth-audit-US-04: Auditor traces an account lifecycle write

**As an** auditor,
**I want** a new user id, a verify that flips, and an account deletion on the identity trail,
**so that** a dispute can name how that user id appeared or left, without the email.

### shared-auth-audit-US-05: Auditor traces a second-factor write

**As an** auditor,
**I want** enabling, disabling, or regenerating recovery codes on the identity trail,
**so that** a takeover of the second factor is a recorded write, without the codes.
