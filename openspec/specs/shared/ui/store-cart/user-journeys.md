## User journeys

### shared-ui-store-cart-US-02: Shopper reviews what the cart holds

**As a** shopper,
**I want** the drawer to show my items on a five-row baseline, with a count
that ignores sold-out items and an edge fade when there are more,
**so that** I can see what I am buying without the drawer changing shape as
the cart fills.

### shared-ui-store-cart-US-03: Shopper opens the cart on current prices

**As a** shopper,
**I want** the drawer to read fresh product status and pricing when it opens,
showing skeletons while that read is in flight,
**so that** I decide against the current prices rather than stale ones.

### shared-ui-store-cart-US-04: Shopper dismisses the cart drawer

**As a** shopper,
**I want** to close the drawer from its close button, the backdrop, or the
Escape key, with the page behind it held still,
**so that** I can leave the cart without losing my place on the page beneath
it.

### shared-ui-store-cart-US-05: Shopper proceeds from the cart to checkout

**As a** shopper,
**I want** the checkout button to show it is redirecting while the
application creates the session,
**so that** I know the checkout is under way, and see the button return to
its label if it fails.

### shared-ui-store-cart-US-06: Shopper opens a cart that held a delisted product

**As a** shopper,
**I want** a product that left the catalogue to disappear after the drawer
finishes loading, with one toast,
**so that** I am not shown a sold-out row for something the store no longer
sells.

### shared-ui-store-cart-US-07: Shopper edits a low-stock line and the warning quiets

**As a** shopper,
**I want** the low-stock warning to hide after I change that line's quantity,
**so that** it does not keep shouting after I have acted, and it returns if the line is adjusted again.

### shared-ui-store-cart-US-08: Shopper raises a line to the last unit the shop has

**As a** shopper,
**I want** a line's stepper to stop where the shop runs out, and the line to
say how many are left,
**so that** I am not still raising a number the checkout will quietly put back
down.
