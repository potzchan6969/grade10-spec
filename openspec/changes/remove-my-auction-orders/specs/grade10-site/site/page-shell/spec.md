# grade10-site/site/page-shell Specification

## Feature set

- Shell around every surface
  - Header, region, footer: one wrapper the site renders every surface into,
    not-found included
  - Landmark structure: exactly one banner, one main, and one contentinfo on
    the page, with the surface inside main
  - No opinion on content: the shell adds no heading, copy, or spacing of its
    own to what a surface renders
- Session-independent chrome
  - Chrome before the session: the header and the footer render before the
    session has resolved
  - Stable layout: no chrome control appears, disappears, or moves when the
    session arrives
- Account control
  - Session-aware entry: a primary Sign In button when signed out, the
    account icon when signed in
  - Account menu: signed in, the sign-in email with its initial avatar above
    My Auctions and Sign Out; Profile joins first wherever the account page is
    carried, and My Orders ahead of My Auctions once Store answers; Sign Out
    stays last; KYC and any item whose page the site
    withholds stay out
  - Account page sign-out: the account page offers Sign Out wherever it is
    carried
- Members-only cart
  - Sign-in before the cart: the Cart control opens sign-in while no session
    is signed in, and the drawer stays closed
  - The cart the ask was for: the drawer opens by itself once the session
    arrives, and nothing is left waiting when the ask is dismissed
  - Active-line count: header and drawer agree without opening the drawer; unknown and signed-out counts stay hidden
- Links only to real surfaces
  - Controls with surfaces behind them: search and cart stay absent until the
    site answers them
  - Reachable links only: a navigation, utility, footer, or legal link appears
    only when its destination exists, except primary-nav Help may name the
    documentation host Product names
  - Current-surface marking: the navigation item owning the current address is
    marked, and none is when no item owns it
- Collector help
  - Header Help: primary nav lists Help after Store Locator when that item is
    present, and after Auction on auction-only nav; Help opens the
    documentation site in a new tab
- Small-width resilience
  - No horizontal overflow: the shell reflows at 375 CSS pixels with every
    control still reachable

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Signed-in collectors open what the build carries from the account menu

The account control of a signed-in collector opens a menu of destinations.

**The menu** - When the collector is signed in, activating the account
control SHALL open a menu that shows the small initial avatar of their
sign-in email, then the email, above the items. The menu SHALL offer My
Auctions and Sign Out, with Sign Out last. Once Store answers, the menu SHALL
also offer My Orders, immediately before My Auctions. Wherever the site
carries the account page, the menu SHALL also offer Profile, as its first
item.

**Withheld pages** - The menu SHALL NOT offer an item whose page the site
withholds: My Orders until Store answers, Profile where the account page is
withheld, and Membership where the membership page is withheld.

**Each item** - Activating Profile SHALL take them to the account page.
Activating My Orders SHALL take them to My Orders at `/profile/orders`.
Activating My Auctions SHALL take them to My Auctions. Activating Sign Out
SHALL start sign-out.

**Sign Out label** - The menu's sign-out item SHALL read "Sign Out".

**Not offered** - The menu SHALL NOT offer KYC.
