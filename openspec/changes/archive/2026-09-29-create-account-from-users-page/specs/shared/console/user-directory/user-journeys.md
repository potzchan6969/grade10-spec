### shared-console-user-directory-US-06: Operator creates an account from the directory

**As an** operator,
**I want** a create dialog that collects name, email, and roles from my
console's vocabulary when the console supplies a create handler, reports the
created account on success, and reports the existing account through
`onOpenExisting` when the email is taken,
**so that** my console opens the account it created or the one already there
without the components deciding what comes next.
