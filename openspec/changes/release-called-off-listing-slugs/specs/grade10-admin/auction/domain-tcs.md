## grade10-admin-auction-e2e-US1: Operator announces an event and puts a lot under it

**As an** auction operator,
**I want** a campaign cover to go public while each lot under it publishes on its own,
**so that** the event is announced without a half-finished lot reaching a collector.

## Reconciliation

**Run:** QA2, 2026-10-12. QA1 used frozen bundle `02ba99d366a1f619b3df386916067b23a31ec77462132a92d7eddd4bd474713f`. QA2 read both independent readings, all 3 deltas, the complete feature maps, current and durable journeys, durable context, and the linked owner decisions. Case dispositions were recorded before scenario links.

- **Disposition** - TC-t49 remains the independent campaign cancellation and reuse route. It checks 2 published lots, released slugs, draft refusal and public replacement. It does not drive the draft/created/closed campaign composition in SC157, so it receives no covers claim for that scenario. The other 3 inherited cases retain their identities, bodies and classifications.
- **Coverage** - Complete case and scenario dispositions, source locations, anchor coverage and carried baseline findings are in the QA2 handoff. Missing scenario links are explicit gaps, not inferred coverage.
- **Decision** - All called-off original slugs are reusable, including earlier records. The eligible current holder answers; otherwise the address is not found. Codes stay reserved and do not become public routes. Bidder history stays with the original listing. Q1-Q4 are settled.
- **Classification** - New and changed active cases remain draft. No runtime execution or human approval is claimed.
