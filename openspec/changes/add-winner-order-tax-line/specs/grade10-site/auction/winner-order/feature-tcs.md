**so that** the lot I won becomes mine inside a deadline I can see, priced for where it is actually going.

## winner-order-US2: Winner follows a settled lot to delivery

**As a** winner who has paid,
**I want** a receipt PDF that says how I paid, what was paid before it and what
is still owed, a tracker, and proof of what was handed over,
**so that** I can account for a high-value purchase without asking Grade10 for records.

## Reconciliation

**Run:** The blind pass read the Purpose, Feature set, `winner-order-US-01`, the proposal, decisions, UI design without scenario dispositions, and the linked PRD. It did not read durable or change requirements.

**Run:** 2026-10-06, QA2 rerun after accept-review, not blind: the delta's requirements and scenarios, `ui-design.md`, the durable suite and the cases above. It split `winner-order-US1-TC31-1`'s expectations by surface, since the page places Tax before Payment Processing Fee and the PDFs before Subtotal. It revised the durable `winner-order-US1-TC1-1` and `winner-order-US1-TC2-1`, which still read Tax as an estimate. It also carries `winner-order-US2-TC1-1` and `winner-order-US2-TC2-1` revised, because this change owns every edit to `Records the winner keeps`.

### Folded

- `winner-order-US1-TC30-1`, Tax reads TBD with its tip before send -> `winner-order-SC-213`
- `winner-order-US1-TC31-1`, sent Tax on the page with its tip and on both PDFs inside the Subtotal -> `winner-order-SC-217`, `winner-order-SC-214`, `winner-order-SC-04`
- `winner-order-US1-TC32-1`, an untaxed invoice shows no Tax line and no tip anywhere -> `winner-order-SC-215`, `winner-order-SC-212`
- `winner-order-US1-TC33-1`, the card fee priced from a Subtotal that includes Tax -> `winner-order-SC-216`

### Revised

- `winner-order-US1-TC1-2`, from `-TC1-1`: Shipping & Handling, Insurance and Tax read TBD before send and no charge is marked as an estimate, instead of reading as estimates; the payable-at-close result is dropped, since `winner-order-US1-TC3-1` refuses payment until the address is confirmed -> `winner-order-SC-04`, `winner-order-SC-213`
- `winner-order-US1-TC2-2`, from `-TC2-1`: Shipping & Handling, Insurance and Tax read TBD, instead of still to be calculated -> `winner-order-SC-213`
- `winner-order-US2-TC1-2`, from `-TC1-1`: the receipt lines read insurance when added and Tax when added, instead of any tax -> `winner-order-SC-18`
- `winner-order-US2-TC2-3`, from `-TC2-1`: the tracker shows the tracking number as the carrier link when the operator recorded a tracker link and as plain text otherwise, and no separate carrier name, instead of the carrier and the tracking number -> `winner-order-SC-20`

### Rejected

- No blind case was dropped.

### Escalated

- None. The blind pass's itemisation reading matched `winner-order-SC-214`; it asked nothing the input left open.

### Carried Unchanged

- **Invoice fields** - `winner-order-SC-05`, `winner-order-SC-38`, `winner-order-SC-39`, `winner-order-SC-62`, `winner-order-SC-63`, `winner-order-SC-69`, `winner-order-SC-110`, `winner-order-SC-111` keep their meaning and their durable coverage. `winner-order-SC-04` changed meaning to a taxed total and is reached above by `winner-order-US1-TC31-1` and `winner-order-US1-TC1-2`
- **Records the winner keeps** - `winner-order-SC-19`, `winner-order-SC-21`, `winner-order-SC-36`, `winner-order-SC-112`, `winner-order-SC-113`, `winner-order-SC-131`, `winner-order-SC-132`, `winner-order-SC-135`, `winner-order-SC-133`, `winner-order-SC-247`, `winner-order-SC-222`, `winner-order-SC-223`, `winner-order-SC-246` keep their meaning and their durable coverage. `winner-order-SC-18` and `winner-order-SC-20` changed and are reached above by `winner-order-US2-TC1-2` and `winner-order-US2-TC2-3`

**Out of suite:** none of this change's scenarios.

| Finding | Disposition |
| --- | --- |
| The winner sees retained facts without the internal reason | **Folded in:** `winner-order-SC-143` |
| Contact Us on a cancelled order reads `order cancelled` | **Folded in:** `winner-order-SC-275` |

| Finding | Disposition |
| --- | --- |
| The winner sees receipts without a second order or deadline | **Folded in:** `winner-order-SC-156` |

Two independent readings of the same anchors: this suite, written without sight
of any requirement, and a scenario draft written without sight of this suite.
What they disagreed about is below.

| Raised | Disposition |
| --- | --- |
| Which clock decides a confirmation sent at 47:59 and arriving at 48:01 | **Folded in.** Nobody had decided it. The requirement now judges a write by the moment Grade10 receives it, and `winner-order-SC-145` and `winner-order-SC-146` are phrased on receipt rather than on submission |
| What the address deadline is measured from on an extended lot | **Folded in.** The scenario pass had already fixed it on the actual close; `winner-order-SC-144` proves it against a lot whose scheduled and actual closes differ |
| Whether a winner may add an address to the account book while the address form is closed | **Folded in** after a grilling round. The account address book is unaffected — `winner-order-SC-151` and `winner-order-US23-TC9-1` |
| Whether a reopen after send does anything | **Already decided**, in `grade10-admin/auction/post-sale`: a reopen is refused once the invoice is sent. The suite could not see it |
| Whether a reopen notifies the winner | **Folded in** once Product settled it: no letter, the operator tells the winner directly — `winner-order-SC-149` and `winner-order-US23-TC10-1` |
| What a missed address deadline does to the reminder letters | **Dropped.** Address reminders belong to the durable Winner Order rules. Recorded here so the next blind pass does not raise it again |
| Whether a winner may change a confirmed address after the deadline | **Dropped** after the planning owner decided that a confirmed address locks on confirm and this change adds no winner change control. The change scenario and its case are retired with their ids; the lock is the durable Winner Order rule |
| Scenarios the payment-deadline requirement restates: `winner-order-SC-31`, `SC-33`, `SC-37` and `SC-107` | **Not this change's.** They are durable scenarios the modified requirement carries unchanged, and the durable suite covers them. This suite adds a case only for the scenarios this change writes |
| What a card session that ends unpaid after the payment deadline does | **Folded in** after the planning owner decided it counts as a failed outcome: the invoice is written `expired` when the session ends and Pay Now stays closed. The requirement is the payment deadline's; `grade10-admin-auction-post-sale-SC-93` and `post-sale-US19-TC9-1` prove it |
| Traces on this delta pointing at feature set groups | **Kept.** The delta's journeys file holds only `winner-order-US-23`; the journeys those cases walk are durable and reach the suite at archive |
| Cases covering behaviour this change no longer carries | **Kept as written.** Every delta here but the payment deadline became ADDED after `check:manual` refused a draft that folded requirements the durable Winner Order rules also folds. Cases reading the lock at send, the seven days from send and the hold release stay in the suite; the requirements they walk are that change's |
| Cases the address deadline on `main` now covers | **Dropped** after the durable Winner Order rules took on the 48-hour address deadline: Contact Us in place of the form, no suspension or cancellation, the displayed deadline, nothing to pay at close, and seven days from send. Its own suite walks them. The rest were renumbered under `winner-order-US23` |

An operator may record a delivery address after the address deadline without
reopening it. Neither reading proposed it; the action is
`complete-auction-post-sale`'s.
