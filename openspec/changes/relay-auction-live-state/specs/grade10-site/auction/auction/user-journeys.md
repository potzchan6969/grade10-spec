### grade10-site-auction-auction-US-02: Collector places a card-backed bid inside the window

**As a** bidder,
**I want** a lot I bid on by its close to stay open until bidding stops,
**so that** a bid placed at the last second can always be answered, up to the lot's cap.

**Accepted by:**

- `grade10-site-auction-auction-SC-23` — The default bid path creates no authorization hold

### grade10-site-auction-auction-US-11: Bidder is held to the close with everyone else

**As a** bidder,
**I want** a lot to stop taking bids at its close for everyone, and a bid to count only once its payment confirms before then,
**so that** nobody wins with a bid that arrived after the close, and a card hold for a bid that did not count is released.

### grade10-site-auction-auction-US-12: Bidder keeps a lot open only by moving its price

**As a** bidder,
**I want** extended bidding to restart only when a bid moves the lot's price,
**so that** a leader cannot keep a lot open by raising their own maximum.
