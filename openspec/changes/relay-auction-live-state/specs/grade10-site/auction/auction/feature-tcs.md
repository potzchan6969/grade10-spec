## grade10-site-auction-auction-US12: Bidder keeps a lot open only by moving its price

**As a** bidder,
**I want** extended bidding to restart only when a bid moves the lot's price,
**so that** a leader cannot keep a lot open by raising their own maximum.

### grade10-site-auction-auction-US12-TC1-1: Equal maximum at a higher price extends the lot

**Classification:**

* **Severity:** critical
* **Priority:** high
* **Status:** draft
* **Behaviour:** positive
* **Type:** functional
* **Suites:** regression
* **Layer:** e2e
* **Automation status:** manual
* **Testability:** automation, manual
* **Trace:** grade10-site-auction-auction-US-12

**Pre-conditions:**

* Bid-time holds are off.
* `<listing_9>` is in extended bidding with its recorded close `<time left before bid>` away.
* customer A leads `<listing_9>` at `<leader price>` with maximum `<user A maximum>`.
* customer B(card linked) is signed in on a separate session, on the lot page for `<listing_9>`.

**Test data:**

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `<listing_9>` | An HKD listing in extended bidding, extension duration `<extension duration>`, no cap |
| `<extension duration>` | 1800s (30mins) |
| `<time left before bid>` | 5 minutes |
| `<leader price>` | 100000 minor units |
| `<user A maximum>` | 200000 minor units |
| `<user B maximum>` | 200000 minor units, equal to `<user A maximum>` |

**Steps:**

1. As customer B, enter `<user B maximum>` in the custom maximum on the bid panel and confirm the bid.
2. Read Highest bid, the leader and Time left.

**Expected Results:**

* Highest bid reads `<user B maximum>`.
* customer A still leads, as the earlier maximum.
* Time left reads `<extension duration>` from customer B's bid.

### grade10-site-auction-auction-US12-TC2-1: Leader raising their own maximum leaves the close where it was

**Classification:**

* **Severity:** critical
* **Priority:** high
* **Status:** draft
* **Behaviour:** positive
* **Type:** functional
* **Suites:** regression
* **Layer:** e2e
* **Automation status:** manual
* **Testability:** automation, manual
* **Trace:** grade10-site-auction-auction-US-12

**Pre-conditions:**

* Bid-time holds are off.
* `<listing_10>` is in extended bidding, its recorded close `<close before raise>`.
* customer A leads `<listing_10>` at `<leader price>` with maximum `<user A maximum>`, and is on its lot page.

**Test data:**

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `<listing_10>` | An HKD listing in extended bidding, extension duration 1800s (30mins), no cap |
| `<close before raise>` | 3 minutes after the raise |
| `<leader price>` | 530000 minor units |
| `<user A maximum>` | 800000 minor units |
| `<raised maximum>` | 900000 minor units |

**Steps:**

1. Select **Raise**, enter `<raised maximum>` and confirm.
2. Read Your maximum, Highest bid and Time left.
3. Wait until `<close before raise>` with no further bid.
4. Read the lot's result.

**Expected Results:**

* Your maximum reads `<raised maximum>`.
* Highest bid stays `<leader price>`.
* The recorded close stays `<close before raise>`, and Time left keeps counting to it.
* The lot closes at `<close before raise>`, customer A winning at `<leader price>`.

## Settled

- The first-bid minimum on a listing with no accepted bid is its opening price: the starting price, or the lowest increment on a 0 start; one increment above the current bid applies from the second bid (decisions Q19, Q27).
- A first bid of 0, or of one minor unit, on a 0 start is a non-goal; no case asserts either.
- The price a lone maximum stands at on a 0 start is auto-bidding's case, not this suite's.
- A valid bid in an extension case is placed by a bidder who does not lead, so it moves the price and restarts the timer; a leader raising their own maximum moves nothing, and is US12's case (decision Q5).
- Between the effective close and the recorded close, a lot takes no bid and names no result; the public status stays Active until the close is recorded (decision Q3).
- A bid at exactly the scheduled close counts on every listing, extension on or off; with no extension reach the effective close is one millisecond after the scheduled close (decision Q34).
